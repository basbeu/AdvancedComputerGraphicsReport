# AdvancedComputerGraphicsReport

This repository shows the report for the project made in CS-440 at EPFL (Spring 2020). 
The report is a webpage *project/report.html*.

The project was to implement the [Nori renderer](https://wjakob.github.io/nori/). The first steps consisted of implementing Nori in five guided assignments and then we were free to choose the extentions we wanted.

At the end of the course, a rendering competition was organised. I ended in the runner-ups with my final image. More informations about the competition in the website of the [Realistic Graphics Lab](https://rgl.epfl.ch/pages/courses/cs440/sp20/competition2020).
